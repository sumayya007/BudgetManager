# BudgetManager
Budget Manager application created in asp.net and sql server
The application allows a user to login in and upload the expense name, expense amount and the allocated budget for the expense. The user can categorize his expense as well as upload the copy of the bill for future reference. He can also mail the list of expenses along with the bill image to his mail or take a print out of the data. It would be very beneficial to keep track of the expenses.
The Asp.net project was done in C# using Visual studio, and the database was managed using Sql Server 2008.
